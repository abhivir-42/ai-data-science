# Data Cleaning Agent Explanation

This directory contains a comprehensive explanation of the data cleaning agent from the AI Data Science Team. The explanation is structured as a series of markdown files, each focusing on a different aspect of the agent.

## Contents

1. [Introduction](00_introduction.md) - Overview of the data cleaning agent and the LangChain/LangGraph frameworks.

2. [DataCleaningAgent Class](01_data_cleaning_agent_class.md) - Explanation of the main class that serves as an entry point for users.

3. [make_data_cleaning_agent Function](02_make_data_cleaning_agent_function.md) - Detailed explanation of the function that creates the LangGraph state machine.

4. [Graph Nodes](03_graph_nodes.md) - Deep dive into each node in the workflow graph and how they interact.

5. [Supporting Templates](04_supporting_templates.md) - Explanation of the template functions and classes that simplify agent creation.

6. [Supporting Parsers, Utils, and Tools](05_supporting_parsers_utils_tools.md) - Overview of the utility functions, parsers, and tools used by the agent.

7. [LangChain and LangGraph Concepts](06_langchain_langgraph_concepts.md) - Detailed explanation of the key concepts from LangChain and LangGraph used in the agent.

8. [Recreation Guide](07_recreation_guide.md) - Step-by-step guide to recreating the data cleaning agent in your own projects.

## How to Use This Explanation

1. Start with the [Introduction](00_introduction.md) to get a high-level overview of the agent and the frameworks it uses.

2. Follow the numbered files in order to progressively build your understanding of the agent, from the user-facing class to the internal implementation details.

3. If you want to recreate the agent for your own projects, jump to the [Recreation Guide](07_recreation_guide.md).

4. For a deeper understanding of specific components, consult the relevant specialized files (e.g., [Supporting Templates](04_supporting_templates.md) for template functions).

## Purpose

This explanation is designed to help you understand how the data cleaning agent works and how you can recreate or extend it for your own projects. It breaks down the complex implementation into manageable pieces, making it accessible even to those who are new to LangChain and LangGraph.

The explanation focuses not just on what the code does, but why it's designed that way, enabling you to adapt the concepts to your own needs.
