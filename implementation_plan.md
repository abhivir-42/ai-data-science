# DataCleaningAgent uAgents Adapter Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to adapt the DataCleaningAgent from the ai-data-science package into a uAgent compatible with the Fetch AI Agentverse.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Setup Environment and Dependencies ✓
- [x] Activate the `/Users/abhivir42/projects/ai-ds-venv` environment
- [x] Install the uagents-adapter package with langchain support
- [x] Install any additional dependencies required

### Step 2: Create the Adapter Module ✓
- [x] Create a new module in the ai_data_science package for uAgents integration
- [x] Create a function to convert the DataCleaningAgent to a uAgent
- [x] Configure the agent to use the Agentverse mailbox service

### Step 3: Register the Agent with Agentverse ✓
- [x] Use the provided API token to register the agent
- [x] Ensure proper agent description and documentation is generated

### Step 4: Create Testing Scripts ✓
- [x] Create a test script to verify local functionality
- [x] Test interaction with the agent through the Agentverse

### Step 5: Documentation ✓
- [x] Update the README with instructions on using the uAgent version
- [x] Document the API for interacting with the agent

## Success Criteria ✓
- [x] The DataCleaningAgent runs as a uAgent
- [x] The agent is registered in the Agentverse
- [x] Other agents/users can interact with it through the Agentverse
- [x] The agent performs data cleaning operations as expected

## Implementation Complete!

We have successfully implemented the DataCleaningAgentAdapter, which allows the DataCleaningAgent from the ai-data-science package to be deployed as a uAgent in the Fetch AI Agentverse.

### Summary of Implementation
1. Created a new `adapters` module in the ai_data_science package
2. Implemented the `DataCleaningAgentAdapter` class to wrap the DataCleaningAgent
3. Added registration with the Agentverse using the uagents-adapter package
4. Created example scripts for deploying and interacting with the agent
5. Updated documentation to explain how to use the adapter

### Next Steps
- Deploy the agent to production using the Agentverse platform
- Monitor the agent's performance and usage
- Extend the adapter to support other agents in the ai-data-science package
