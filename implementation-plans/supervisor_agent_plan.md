# Supervisor Agent Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a supervisor agent that intelligently orchestrates the data cleaning, feature engineering, and H2O ML agents based on natural language user requests.

## Requirements Analysis
- [x] Identify existing agents (data_cleaning_agent.py, feature_engineering_agent.py, h2o_ml_agent.py)
- [x] Create supervisor agent with natural language parsing
- [x] Implement CSV URL to DataFrame conversion
- [x] Build agent orchestration logic
- [x] Ensure string-only outputs with file path strings
- [x] Add error handling and default parameter management
- [x] Test with various user request scenarios
- [x] Create usage examples and documentation

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Core Supervisor Agent Structure
- [x] Create `supervisor_agent.py` in `src/agents/`
- [x] Implement CSV URL downloading and DataFrame conversion
- [x] Build natural language intent parsing
- [x] Create agent orchestration workflow

### 2. Intent Recognition Logic
- [x] Parse requests for data cleaning keywords ("clean", "preprocess", "missing values")
- [x] Detect feature engineering needs ("features", "transform", "encode")
- [x] Identify ML modeling requests ("model", "predict", "train", "ml")
- [x] Handle combination requests ("clean and build model")

### 3. Agent Integration
- [x] Import and initialize existing agents
- [x] Pass DataFrames between agents in correct sequence
- [x] Handle agent-specific parameters from user requests
- [x] Collect outputs from each agent

### 4. Output Management
- [x] Convert all outputs to strings
- [x] Save generated files and return paths as strings
- [x] Create comprehensive string reports
- [x] Handle different output types (plots, models, data files)

### 5. Error Handling & Validation
- [x] Validate CSV URL accessibility
- [x] Handle agent execution failures gracefully
- [x] Provide meaningful error messages as strings
- [x] Fallback strategies for partial failures

### 6. Testing & Examples
- [x] Test data cleaning only scenarios
- [x] Test feature engineering workflows
- [x] Test full ML pipeline requests
- [x] Create example usage scripts
- [x] Document common use cases

## Agent Flow Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Clean this data"
```
CSV URL â†’ DataFrame â†’ Data Cleaning Agent â†’ String Report
```

### Scenario 2: "Create features for ML"
```
CSV URL â†’ DataFrame â†’ Data Cleaning Agent â†’ Feature Engineering Agent â†’ String Report
```

### Scenario 3: "Build a prediction model"
```
CSV URL â†’ DataFrame â†’ Data Cleaning Agent â†’ Feature Engineering Agent â†’ H2O ML Agent â†’ String Report + Model Path
```

### Scenario 4: "Just show me data quality issues"
```
CSV URL â†’ DataFrame â†’ Data Cleaning Agent (analysis only) â†’ String Report
```

## Success Criteria
- [x] Supervisor correctly interprets natural language requests
- [x] Agents are called in appropriate sequence based on request
- [x] All outputs are strings (reports + file paths)
- [x] Error handling works for common failure cases
- [x] Integration with existing agents works seamlessly
- [x] Ready for ASI1 LLM integration (string-only interface)

## Implementation Complete! ðŸŽ‰

The supervisor agent has been successfully implemented with all the requested features:

1. **Natural Language Processing**: Parses user requests to determine which agents to use
2. **CSV URL Handling**: Downloads and converts remote CSV files to DataFrames
3. **Agent Orchestration**: Intelligently calls agents in the correct sequence
4. **String-Only Outputs**: All results are returned as strings, including file paths
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages
6. **ASI1 LLM Ready**: Designed for integration with string-only interfaces

### Usage Examples:
- `process_csv_request(csv_url, "clean this data")` â†’ Data cleaning only
- `process_csv_request(csv_url, "create features")` â†’ Cleaning + Feature engineering
- `process_csv_request(csv_url, "build a model")` â†’ Full pipeline (cleaning + features + ML)

The supervisor agent is now ready for production use!
