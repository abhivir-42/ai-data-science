# Implementation Plan: DataLoaderToolsAgent

## Overview
The DataLoaderToolsAgent provides users with an AI assistant that can load and explore data files in their local file system. It's designed to handle various file formats and help with data discovery.

## Tasks

### Core Agent Functionality
- [x] Create basic agent structure with ReAct pattern
- [x] Implement basic prompt template for the agent
- [x] Add state management for tracking loaded data
- [x] Implement ability to invoke the agent with instructions

### Data Loading Tools
- [x] Implement CSV file loading
- [x] Implement JSON file loading
- [x] Implement directory listing
- [x] Implement file search by pattern
- [x] Implement file info extraction
- [x] Add support for loading multiple files

### File System Navigation
- [x] Allow navigation between directories
- [x] Add recursive directory search
- [x] Implement file pattern matching
- [x] Add support for getting detailed file info

### User Interface
- [x] Add methods to extract loaded data as DataFrame
- [x] Add methods to get internal agent messages
- [x] Add methods to view tool calls made by agent
- [x] Create formatted output for DataFrame preview

### Testing
- [x] Create sample data files for testing
- [x] Implement basic unit tests for data loader tools
- [x] Add test script to verify agent functionality
- [x] Ensure tests work without API key for CI/CD

### Integration
- [x] Create adapter for uAgents compatibility
- [x] Implement registration with Fetch.ai Agentverse
- [x] Add example usage script
- [x] Create data pipeline example with DataCleaningAgent

### Path Fixes and Improvements
- [x] Fix import paths to use 'src' instead of 'ai_data_science'
- [x] Update templates and utils to use correct imports
- [x] Add missing regex utility functions
- [x] Ensure all tools work with new path structure

## Next Steps
- [ ] Add support for more file formats (Excel, Parquet, etc.)
- [ ] Improve error handling and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Enhance documentation with more examples
- [ ] Add streaming support for large files
- [ ] Implement data validation checks during loading
