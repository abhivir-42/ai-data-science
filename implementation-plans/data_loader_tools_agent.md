# DataLoaderToolsAgent Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the DataLoaderToolsAgent, which is responsible for loading data from various sources and formats based on user instructions. The agent is built using LangChain and Fetch.ai uAgents to provide a flexible and extensible data loading solution.

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] Create data loading tool functions
  - [x] Implement `load_file` for loading individual data files (CSV, Excel, JSON, Parquet)
  - [x] Implement `load_directory` for batch loading multiple files
  - [x] Implement `list_directory_contents` for exploring file systems
  - [x] Implement `list_directory_recursive` for deeper file system exploration
  - [x] Implement `get_file_info` for analyzing file metadata
  - [x] Implement `search_files_by_pattern` for finding specific files

- [x] Create the main DataLoaderToolsAgent class
  - [x] Implement core agent functionality using LangChain's ReAct agent framework
  - [x] Implement state management with AgentState for tracking agent progress
  - [x] Set up the `make_data_loader_tools_agent` factory function
  - [x] Implement utility methods for accessing loaded data and agent results

- [x] Implement uAgent adapter for Fetch.ai integration
  - [x] Create `DataLoaderToolsAgentAdapter` class
  - [x] Implement registration method for Agentverse
  - [x] Support API key authentication for Agentverse
  - [x] Add helper methods for loading data through the adapter

- [x] Update package structure
  - [x] Update `__init__.py` files to expose new classes
  - [x] Create missing utility functions like `get_tool_call_names`
  - [x] Ensure proper imports throughout the codebase

- [x] Create examples and documentation
  - [x] Add example script showcasing combined DataLoaderToolsAgent and DataCleaningAgent
  - [x] Add example script for registering both agents with Agentverse
  - [x] Document agent usage and integration patterns

## Integration Points

- The DataLoaderToolsAgent can be used as a standalone agent or as part of a pipeline
- Integration with DataCleaningAgent allows for complete data processing workflows
- Fetch.ai uAgents integration enables communication with other agents in the Agentverse

## Testing Strategy

1. Test individual data loading tool functions with various file types
2. Test the complete agent with simple data loading instructions
3. Test uAgent registration and communication with Agentverse
4. Test integration with DataCleaningAgent in a complete pipeline

## Next Steps

- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for all components
- [ ] Enhance data loader tools with authentication support for cloud storage
- [ ] Add support for streaming data sources
- [ ] Add more examples for complex data loading scenarios
- [ ] Create a monitoring dashboard for tracking agent operations
- [ ] Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms
