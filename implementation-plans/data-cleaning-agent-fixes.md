# Implementation Plan: Data Cleaning Agent Fixes

## Problem Analysis
The error occurs when trying to convert the cleaned data from a dictionary back to a DataFrame:
```
ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. The requested array has an inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimensions. The detected shape was (2,) + inhomogeneous part.
```

This typically happens when:
1. The dictionary structure returned by the cleaning function isn't compatible with pd.DataFrame()
2. There are inconsistencies in the data structure being returned

## Tasks

- [x] Fix the `get_data_cleaned()` method to handle potential format issues
- [x] Improve the data conversion in the execute_data_cleaner_code function
- [x] Update the show-works.py example to use better error handling
- [x] Create additional example files demonstrating different use cases
- [x] Add proper logging to help diagnose issues
- [x] Enhance the presentation markdown file with more accurate code examples
- [x] Test the solution with the Kaggle housing price dataset

## Implementation Details

### 1. Fix the data_cleaning_agent.py ✓
- [x] Update the `get_data_cleaned()` method to include proper error handling
- [x] Make the post-processing function in execute_data_cleaner_code more robust
- [x] Ensure the cleaning function returns a well-structured DataFrame

### 2. Improve the show-works.py example ✓
- [x] Add better error handling
- [x] Include progress updates during processing
- [x] Make output clearer and more presentation-friendly

### 3. Create dedicated example files ✓
- [x] Create a basic example: basic_cleaning.py
- [x] Create a presentation demo: presentation_demo.py

### 4. Enhance presentation materials ✓
- [x] Update code examples to match working implementations
- [x] Include explanations of how the system works

## Testing Results
- [x] Basic cleaning example works correctly
- [x] Show-works example runs successfully
- [x] Presentation demo with visualizations works with missing values warnings

## Next Steps
- [ ] Further enhance the error handling in the generated cleaning code to avoid pandas warnings
- [ ] Expand the examples to show more complex use cases
- [ ] Create a web interface for easier demonstration

## Summary
The data cleaning agent has been successfully fixed and improved. The main issue was in the format conversion when retrieving the cleaned data. We've added robust error handling and format conversion logic to handle various data structures. The examples have been updated to provide a clearer demonstration of the agent's capabilities.

The agent now successfully cleans the Kaggle housing price dataset, handling missing values and converting data types appropriately. The presentation has been enhanced with better code examples and explanations.
