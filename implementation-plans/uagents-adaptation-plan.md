# uAgents Adaptation Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to adapt our existing langchain/langgraph agents to the uAgents ecosystem using the uagents_adapter library.

## Required Tasks

- [x] Check if the langchain/langgraph implementations of our agents are complete
  - [x] Verify data_cleaning_agent.py functionality
  - [x] Verify data_loader_tools_agent.py functionality

- [x] Update the uagents_adapter.py to ensure compatibility with latest uAgents version
  - [x] Update import statements to match current uAgents API
  - [x] Add better error handling and logging
  - [x] Add automatic loading of API keys from .env file
  - [x] Add proper wrapper functions for agent invocation

- [x] Create an example script to test and demonstrate the agents
  - [x] Create a script to test the data cleaning agent
  - [x] Create a script to test the data loader agent
  - [x] Add proper exception handling and error reporting

- [x] Document the usage and limitations
  - [x] Add comments to the code
  - [x] Update the README

- [x] Test and verify agent registration with Agentverse
  - [x] Register the data cleaning agent
  - [x] Register the data loader agent
  - [x] Verify communication between agents
  - [x] Test cleanup and deregistration

## Dependencies
- uagents-adapter >= 2.2.0 
- python-dotenv
- langchain
- langgraph
- pandas

## Implementation Notes

- The uagents_adapter.py file has been updated to support the latest uAgents API
- We've added automatic loading of API keys from the .env file
- Wrapper functions have been created to handle agent invocation
- Support for cleanup and deregistration has been added
- A test script has been created in examples/test_uagents_adapters.py
- The README has been updated with usage instructions and examples
- Added uagents_interaction_demo.py to demonstrate agent communication

## Running the Tests

To test the agents:

1. Make sure the virtual environment is activated:
   ```
   source /Users/abhivir42/projects/ai-ds-venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install 'uagents-adapter>=2.2.0' python-dotenv
   ```

3. Add your API keys to the .env file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
   AGENTVERSE_API_TOKEN=your-agentverse-token
   ```

4. Run the test script:
   ```
   python ai-data-science/examples/test_uagents_adapters.py --all
   ```

5. To test individual agents:
   ```
   python ai-data-science/examples/test_uagents_adapters.py --cleaner
   python ai-data-science/examples/test_uagents_adapters.py --loader
   ```

6. To test agent interaction:
   ```
   python ai-data-science/examples/uagents_interaction_demo.py
   ```

## Runtime Behavior

When running the interaction demo:

1. Sample data is created and saved to CSV
2. Both agents are created and registered with Agentverse
3. The demo simulates communication between the agents:
   - The loader agent loads the data from the CSV file
   - The data is then passed to the cleaner agent for processing
4. Both agents remain running and registered with Agentverse
5. Agent addresses are displayed, which can be used by other agents to communicate
6. Ctrl+C can be used to stop the agents and properly clean up

## Verifying Registration with Agentverse

To verify that the agents are properly registered with Agentverse:

1. Run the interaction demo
2. Note the agent addresses displayed in the console
3. These addresses can be used by other uAgents to communicate with our agents
4. Cleanup is handled automatically when the script is terminated with Ctrl+C
