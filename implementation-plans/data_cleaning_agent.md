# Implementation Plan: DataCleaningAgent

## Overview
The DataCleaningAgent provides an AI assistant that can process datasets based on user-defined instructions or default cleaning steps. It can handle common data cleaning tasks like handling missing values, removing outliers, fixing data types, and other routine cleaning operations.

## Tasks

### Core Agent Functionality
- [x] Create basic agent structure with state management
- [x] Set up agent workflow using LangGraph
- [x] Implement node functions for different stages of cleaning
- [x] Create factory function for agent instantiation
- [x] Implement retry mechanism for failed cleaning attempts

### Data Cleaning Features
- [x] Add support for recommended default cleaning steps
- [x] Implement code generation for data cleaning functions
- [x] Add execution environment for agent-generated code
- [x] Implement error handling and code fixing
- [x] Support user-defined cleaning instructions

### User Interface
- [x] Implement methods to get cleaned data
- [x] Add options to view generated cleaning code
- [x] Add methods to view recommended cleaning steps
- [x] Create workflow summary and visualization
- [x] Add optional human-in-the-loop review

### Logging and Reproducibility
- [x] Add logging system for agent operations
- [x] Implement code saving to files
- [x] Create detailed execution logs
- [x] Add support for checkpointing
- [x] Store original and cleaned data for comparison

### Integration
- [x] Create adapter for uAgents compatibility
- [x] Implement registration with Fetch.ai Agentverse
- [x] Add example scripts for usage
- [x] Create integrated pipeline with DataLoaderToolsAgent

### Path Fixes and Improvements
- [x] Fix import paths to use 'src' instead of 'ai_data_science'
- [x] Update templates and utils to use correct imports
- [x] Add missing regex utility functions
- [x] Ensure all functions work with new path structure

## Next Steps
- [ ] Add support for more advanced cleaning techniques
- [ ] Implement data validation post-cleaning
- [ ] Add more documentation and examples
- [ ] Create additional visualization options for data changes
- [ ] Support cleaning operations across multiple datasets
